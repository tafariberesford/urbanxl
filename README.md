Urban XL

## Project Description
Urban XL is a site that will show the top 10 hip-hop albums that were released in 2021 so far. This will be based on the opinion of Tafari Beresford. Urban XL will also show my own personal review of each album that made it onto the list. This app will also include a list of the most anticipated upcoming hip-hop albums to be released later this year as well.
